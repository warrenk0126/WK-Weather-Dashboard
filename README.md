# WK-Weather-Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is segmented into three sections for display: one for the current forecast of the inputted city; another for the 5-Day Forecast; then an interactive search history of the latest cities searched.
OpenWeather's 5-Day Forecast & Geocoding APIs have been implemented. Extensive comments have been added to maximize ease of comprehension in case of a need to refer to the code in the future.
